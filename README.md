===============================================================
Created by Daniel Dragon for the Operating Systems at Saint Rose.

For a list of commands, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/Dan-Baba/realOS/wiki/">wiki found here</a>.

ChangeLog:
Modified man command, removed '(hopefully)', will try to give accurate results.

Testing Methodology:
Tested date by ensuring today was the date given. Also tested the lowercase date format options, which seem to work.<br />
Tested whereami, but it's static at the moment so that's easy.<br />
Tested rot13 by <a href="http://www.rot13.com/">using this calculator</a> to ensure accuracy.<br />
